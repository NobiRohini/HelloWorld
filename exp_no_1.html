    <h1>Welcome to Robotics Model:</h1>
    <h2>Robotics Plays a Crucial Role in our Lives;</h2>
    <h3>Robotics is the intersection of Science, Engeering and Technology;</h3>
    <h4>It produces Machines called Robots;</h4>
    <h5>We can program in many ways like humanoid robots and Machine Robots;</h5>
    <h6>Robots are gaining Inteletucal and Mechanical Capabilites;</h6>
    <p>Robotics, Design, Construction, and use of machines (Robots) to perform tasks done traditionally by human
        beings.<br>
        Are widely used in such industries as automobile manufacture to perform simple repetitive tasks, and in
        industries where work must be performed in environments hazardous to humans.<br>
        Many aspects of robotics involve artificial intelligence;<br> May be equipped with the equivalent of human
        senses such as vision, touch, and the ability to sense temperature.<br>
        Some are even capable of simple decision making, and current robotics research is geared toward devising robots
        with a degree of self-sufficiency that will permit mobility and decision-making in an unstructured
        environment.<br>
        Today’s industrial robots do not resemble human beings;<br>
        Robot in human form is called an Android.<br></p>
    <img src="Image-1.jpg"><br>
    <p>Mechanical bots come in all shapes and sizes to efficiently carry out the task for which they are designed.<br>
        All robots vary in design, functionality and degree of autonomy.<br> From the 0.2 millimeter-long “RoboBee” to
        the 200 meter-long robotic shipping vessel “Vindskip,” <br>
        robots are emerging to carry out tasks that humans simply can’t. </p>
    <h1>Pre-Progrmmed Robots</h1>
    <p>Pre-programmed robots operate in a controlled environment where they do simple, monotonous tasks.<br>
        An example of a pre-programmed robot would be a mechanical arm on an automotive assembly line.<br>
        The arm serves one function — to weld a door on, to insert a certain part into the engine, etc.<br>
        — and its job is to perform that task longer, faster and more efficiently than a human</p>

    <h2>Humanoid Robots</h2>
    <p>Humanoid robots are robots that look like and/or mimic human behavior. <br>
        These robots usually perform human-like activities (like running, jumping and carrying objects), <br>
        and are sometimes designed to look like us, even having human faces and expressions.<br>
        Two of the most prominent examples of humanoid robots are Hanson Robotics’ Sophia <br>
        (in the video above) and Boston Dynamics’ Atlas.</p>

    <h3>Atonomous Robots</h3>
    <p>Autonomous robots operate independently of human operators.<br>
         These robots are usually designed to carry out tasks in open environments that do not require human supervision.<br>
          They are quite unique because they use sensors to perceive the world around them,<br> and then employ decision-making structures (usually a computer) to take the optimal next step based on their data and mission.<br>
           An example of an autonomous robot would be the Roomba vacuum cleaner,<br>
            which uses sensors to roam freely throughout a home.</p>

            <h4>Examples of Autonomous Robots</h4>



                <ul>
                    <li>Cleaning Bots</li>
                    <li>Lawn Trimming</li>
                    <li>Hospitality Bots</li>
                    <li>Autonomous Drones</li>
                    <li>Medical Assitant Bots</li>
                </ul>


                <h4>Teleoperated Robots</h4>
                <p>Teleoperated robots are semi-autonomous bots that use a wireless network to enable human control from a safe distance.<br>
                     These robots usually work in extreme geographical conditions, weather, circumstances, etc.<br>
                      Examples of teleoperated robots are the human-controlled submarines<br>
                     used to fix underwater pipe leaks during<br>
                     the BP oil spill or drones used to detect landmines on a battlefield.</p>

<h4>Agumented Robots</h4>
<p>Augmenting robots either enhance current human capabilities or replace the capabilities a human may have lost.<br>
     The field of robotics for human augmentation is a field where science fiction could become reality very soon,<br> 
     with bots that have the ability to redefine the definition of humanity <br>by making humans faster and stronger. Some examples of current augmenting robots are <br>
    robotic prosthetic limbs or exoskeletons used to lift hefty weights.</p><br>
